## Project 1: Fleet Rental Optimization for Fuel Oil Delivery
**Description:** In this project, I tackled the complex challenge faced by a private fuel oil delivery company operating in a highly seasonal market. With the majority of their deliveries concentrated in a five-month period and significant fluctuations in demand, I developed an optimization strategy to determine the most cost-effective combination of rental contracts for their truck fleet. By considering 12-month, 6-month, and 3-month rental options, I aimed to minimize the annual rental cost while ensuring the company met monthly delivery demand. This project involved formulating a linear programming model and implementing a heuristic approach to provide practical solutions. Ultimately, the optimization strategy enabled the company to efficiently allocate its resources, reducing costs and ensuring timely deliveries to their customers.

## Project 2: Multi-Objective IoT Service Placement Optimization
**Description:** In Project 2, I recreated, implemented, and evaluated an IoT service placement algorithm from a research paper by Liu, C., Wang, J., Zhou, L., et al. The goal was to benchmark this algorithm against other metaheuristic optimization methods commonly used in Fog Computing. This project aimed to assess the algorithm's performance, efficiency, and scalability, contributing to the field's advancement and guiding decision-makers in optimizing IoT service deployments.

## Project 4: Window Profile Stock Management Software Development
**Description:** Developed software to optimize the management of profile stocks for a window manufacturing company, Vulex. The software allows the company to defer window production by one week on average to optimize profile usage. The objective is to achieve cost savings that pay off the software investment in just three years. The software enables the company to delay window production by one week on average, reducing costs and improving resource utilization. The goal is to recover the software investment within three years through cost savings. The project involves complex calculations, cost analysis, and customer satisfaction metrics to provide a comprehensive solution.
